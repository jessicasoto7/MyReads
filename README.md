## Overview

In this project, I added functionality to the app. The app has 3 book sections or shelfs(Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read). In which you may make a selection to add a book to a shelf or remove a book. You can also search for books by clicking the green + button in the right corner.

### What do I do from here?

Feel free to fork it on your GitHub or clone it on Git Bash.

To get started right away:

1.install all project dependencies with npm install
2.start the development server with npm start
